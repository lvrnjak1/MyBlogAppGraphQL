Simple web application used as a client for a [GraphQL API](https://github.com/lvrnjak1/MyBlogServer). This was a demonstrative app developed to showcase the abilities of GraphQL as well as some differences to the REST API approach in my bachelor's disertation paper. To compare I have developed an equivalent [Rest client](https://github.com/lvrnjak1/MyBlogAppRest).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and it uses Apollo Client for communication with the GraphQL API.

The app is available at: [My Blog App](https://lvrnjak1-blog-app.herokuapp.com/)
